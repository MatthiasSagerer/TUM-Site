        <h2>BasicCalc - Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            BasicCalc was one of the first software projects I did completely on my own, the
            <br>first "real" app I created and the first one I released. As it is just a calculator for
            <br> basic operations, there isn't any useful data to collect. Therefore, I don't collect any
            <br> data with this app.
        </p>
        <p>
            In case you are interested in how the app works, you can take a look at the code in
            <br> the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MatthiasSagerer/BasicCalculatorApp">GitHub repository</a>.
            If you find any bugs in the app, I would appreciate if you
            <br>report them in the Repository with an <i>issue</i>. Also, feel free to give suggestion for
            <br> improvements or functionality extensions, either in text form or directly as code.
        </p>
